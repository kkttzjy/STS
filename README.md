# Stochastic tree search (STS)
The R codes with two real data analysis examples for the stochastic tree search (STS) method: both linear and curved tree methods are include. 
"our method with line search.R" is the R code for our linear tree method, and "curvetree_app.R" is the R code for our linear tree method. "pseudotime_calculation.R" is the code to calculate the pseudotime for a given tree.
